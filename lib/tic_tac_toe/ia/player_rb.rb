    # Rule Based - to implement
    # src: https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JavaGame_TicTacToe_AI.html
    #
    # For Tic-tac-toe, the rules, in the order of importance, are:
    #
    #  R1: If I have a winning move, take it.
    #  R2: If the opponent has a winning move, block it.
    #  R3: If I can create a fork (two winning ways) after this move, do it.
    #  R4: Do not let the opponent creating a fork after my move.
    #     \ Opponent may block your winning move and create a fork.
    #  R5: Place in the position such as I may win in the most number of possible ways.
    #
    # Comments:
    # - R1 and R2 can be programmed easily.
    # - R3 is harder.
    # - R4 is even harder because you need to lookahead one opponent move, after your move.
    # - R5, you need to count the number of possible winning ways.
    #
    # Note: Rule-based strategy is only applicable for simple game such as Tic-tac-toe and Othello.
